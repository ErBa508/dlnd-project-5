## Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Project 5: Generate faces

Project file code can be found at: **dlnd_face_generation.ipynb**

Project completed using [floydhub.com](https://www.floydhub.com).

### Project summary:
Use generative adversarial networks to generate new handwritten digit (MNIST) images and face images (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset). A generator synthesizes the fake images from random noise (using a deep Convolutional Neural Network) while the discriminator estimates the probability that the images are fake or real and provides feedback to the generator.
